# A Centralized Healthcare System

This was a demo product idea we created for Dusk Till Dawn Hackathon By NSS Palakkad. The concept is simple: we create an application that allows doctors and hospitals to upload patients' private documents, such as scan reports and health charts. By doing so, we can provide a centralized platform for doctors to access patients' records, even if they have been transferred from one hospital to another. This can help doctors identify which documents are real and who treated the patient previously, ultimately improving the quality of healthcare.

To ensure the security of the sensitive information being uploaded, it is important to use modern technologies to secure the files. This can include implementing proper access controls and encryption, as well as performing regular security audits and updates to ensure that the application remains secure over time. From a technical standpoint, there are many tools and frameworks available to help build this application. Depending on the specific requirements, a combination of front-end and back-end technologies may be used. Overall, creating a secure and reliable platform for doctors to access patients' records is a complex task that requires careful planning and execution. However, with the right team and tools, it is definitely achievable.
